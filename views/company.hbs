            <p class="text-2xl">
                The team and I started Javolin from our offices in Atlanta GA with the goal of increasing efficiencies in the way
                businesses, banks, and government institutions engage in and transact financial services domestically and across
                borders. Over the past 25 years of traveling, and conducting business internationally, I noted big impediments facing
                this client group on the Continent of Africa. So, we embarked upon making a difference… and in a very short period of
                time, we have.
                
                During our journey, we’ve noticed that the challenges we are addressing are just as germane for clients in emerging
                areas of the United States, such as municipal cash collections, to financial service companies needing to connect in
                neighboring countries in Africa. Today we have great partners and great clients. We believe we are making an impact one
                transaction at a time. </p>
