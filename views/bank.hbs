                        Javolin is connecting with many of the leading financial institutions on the continent via API
                        and leveraging our App and digital infrastructure to facilitate loans and services
                        to their current customers and tapping the unbanked customers in local and international markets.

                        The API connection to our banking partners allows Javolin customers to apply for products from
                        multiple banks in one digital application process.  We are strategic partners with the banks.
                        Itâ€™s a winning solution for both the financial institutions and customers.

                        Because of the lack of physical branch locations in certain markets, banks can now reach their customers
                        and cut down on the acquisition cost. Customers also win by making the financial institutions compete for
                        their business resulting in better terms and more options.

                        We also assist our banking partners with foreign exchange solutions that can be accessed directly through our platforms.
